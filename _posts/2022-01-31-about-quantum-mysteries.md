# About Quantum mysteries 

In this blog I am trying to clarify mysteries of Quantum Mechanics, mainly to myself. On very high level to start with.  
I will add more flesh on the bones as time permits and comprehension allows.  
Eventually, there will hopefully be information on even genetic level in addition to bones and muscles ;-)  

At the same time, I am familiarizing myself with GitHub Blogs.  


I warmly welcome comments, advice, counsel and such from the audience. Both on mysteries themselves but also on making use of GitHub Blogs

## Superposition

## Entanglement

It's like a pair of gloves. You normally have them both. But you could send one for Liisa, say the left hand one,  
and the other for Pekka. Once Liisa receives her glove, she knows right away that Pekka is receiving the right hand one.  
No mystery in that.

The same can go on with particles, e.g. between electrons in Cooper pair.  
In Cooper pair two electrons get bound together in low temperature superconducting state. These bound electrons have opposite spins. These bound electrons can be separated by SET - Single-electron transistor. Once these electrons then are transferred in a lead apart from each other, the spins remaining opposite to each other.  
No mystery in this either. Of course it is harder to believe by a human, who is not able to perceive event in this scale.

## Tunneling

## Interference

destructive or constructive

## Uncertainty Principle

## Wave-Particle duality
